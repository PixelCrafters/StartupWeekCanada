<p>The original StartupWeek was created by Andrew Hyde in Boulder, CO. Andrew has rejoined UP Global, the non-profit behind Startup Weekend, to roll out Startup Week around the world. <a href="http://tech.co/marc-nager-startup-week-2014-05">Read more about UP Global / Startup Week here »</a></p>
<p>Here on the northern side of the maple syrup curtain, we're organizing to start running Startup Week events as well. We hope to secure some national sponsors and help UP Global build the template for events here.</p>

<p>The goal for a Startup Week is to celebrate tech entrepreneurship across the ecosystem of a city or region. From weekend hack events where people are experiencing building their first startups, to established companies looking to grow and hire, all stages of businesses are included. Take the opportunity to tell stories about the successes of the companies and people that make up your community.</p>

<p>The basic format for the week is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Events:</strong> everything from talks, workshops, keynotes and more. Many of them can be hosted directly in company offices, giving an opportunity for people to see inside these businesses. Design, Marketing, Development, Business etc. - all topics should be represented to include items of interest for everyone. These can range from 30 person meetups in a large boardroom to 200 person keynotes with an out-of-town speaker.</li>
  <li><strong>Hiring:</strong> highlight all the companies that are hiring, and promote the opportunities available. In Boulder, they even <a href="http://boulderstartupweek.com/we-will-fly-you-to-boulder/">fly in top talent</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Celebration:</strong> a very large kickoff or closing event that might include pitches, awards, keynote speakers, and just general connection making and networking.</li>
  <li><strong>Press:</strong> everyone in the community working together to tell their local stories to the city as a whole, as well as carrying that story nationally or internationally</li>
</ul>
